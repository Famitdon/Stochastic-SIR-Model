# Stochastic-SIR-Model
A Stochastic SIR Model adds randomness to simulate disease spread by using probabilities for infection and recovery. This captures real-world variability, especially in small populations, and provides more realistic epidemic predictions, useful for testing interventions under uncertain conditions.
